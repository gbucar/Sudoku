# Sudoku
Sudoku maker that creates random sudoku every time you run it

Just run it and it will create random sudoku with random numbers hidden. Sudoku will be saved in picture called "sudoku.jpg". 

Based on my estimations, this program can create around 9! * 27 * 4 different sudokus (but I wouldn't trust this number ğŸ˜‚).

Have fun with it!
